# Pathfinder-Algorithm-Analysis
This project involves the investigation of both Dijkstra's algorithm for minimising the travel distance between each vertex in a network, and also implements Prim's method for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of a network graph. 

This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm, both by using an Object Oriented Approach, whereby each Edge and Vertex was an instance of it's own class (inspired by https://youtu.be/_B5cx-WD5EA?si=uA7EvqYeB_MyDiPv) and by simply using an adjacency list. This method was then applied to calculate the shortest distance to visit 12 pubs in my own hometown of Youghal. Very important use. 

Prim's method for determining the Minimum Spanning Tree of a network was also implemented. 

Libraries used: Networkx, Matplotlib, Heapq, Pandas, Numpy
