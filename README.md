# Dijkstra's Algorithm and Prim's Method Implementation
## Overview
This project investigates Dijkstra's algorithm for minimizing travel distance between vertices in a network and implements Prim's method for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a network graph. It applies these algorithms to practical scenarios, including calculating the shortest distance to visit 12 pubs in Youghal.

## Algorithms Implemented
 - Dijkstra's Algorithm:

## Implemented using two methods:
 - Object Oriented Approach: Each Edge and Vertex represented by its own class.
 - Adjacency List: A simpler method using adjacency lists.
Calculates the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices in the graph.

## Prim's Method:
 - Implemented to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a network graph.
 - Constructs a subtree of the graph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight.
## Libraries Used
 - Networkx: For graph representation and algorithms.
 - Matplotlib: For visualizing graphs and paths.
 - Heapq: For priority queue operations used in Prim's algorithm.
 - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (if applicable).
 - Numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation (if applicable).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path calculations and Prim's method for Minimum Spanning Tree determination. By implementing these algorithms in Python and utilizing libraries for graph representation and visualization, it provides insights into optimizing travel routes and network connectivity analysis.

Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the project's functionality and extend its applications in network optimization and graph theory.
